* TODO Build application level client
  - start a process that can respond to messages
  - initializes with the homeserver
  - logs in user and holds onto access token
  - performs api requests

** TODO Use Authorization header for token
  Using a query string right now after following an example.
  I'd like to modify the =post= function to use the token

** TODO implement client sync request to poll for events

   #+begin_quote
   Retrieving timeline events, though, is a bit more complicated and is done using
   a GET request on the /_matrix/client/r0/sync endpoint. Where it gets tricky is in
   the fact that this endpoint isn’t specific to a room, so it returns every event
   received in any room you’re in, along with some presence event, invites, etc.
