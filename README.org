* tuvix

A bot for Matrix written in Erlang

[[file:tuvix.jpg]]

** Running with rebar3

assuming you have [[https://www.rebar3.org/][rebar3]] installed and configured to use Hex.pm, you may want to:

#+begin_example
rebar3 update
rebar3 compile
#+end_example

before starting. it should install the =jsone= dependency.
now that the tuvix app is setup properly, it seems
like the following shell command will compile tuvix as well.

#+begin_example
rebar3 shell
1> Pid = tuvix:start("https://matrix.foo.bar", "userid", "pwd").
#+end_example

This will spawn a process that logs in and begins polling for
events in the Matrix bot dev chat room
