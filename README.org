* tuvix

A bot for Matrix written in Erlang

[[file:tuvix.jpg]]

** Running with rebar3

assuming you have [[https://www.rebar3.org/][rebar3]] installed 
and configured to use [[https://hex.pm/docs/rebar3_usage][Hex.pm]], you may want to:

#+begin_example
rebar3 update
rebar3 compile
#+end_example

before starting. it should install the =jsone= dependency.
now that the tuvix app is setup properly, it seems
like the following shell command will compile tuvix as well.

Initialize the Tuvix bot with your homeserver, its user name
and password.

#+begin_example
rebar3 shell
1> Pid = tuvix:start("matrix.foo.bar", "userid", "pwd").
#+end_example

Tuvix will echo any message with @tuvix in it in the matrix dev
bot room.
